General & QoL
x Validate orders for a player as soon as they submit their turn
x Add support to the level editor for adding units and buildings
x Add saving games mid-combat
    x Save and load piece HP
x Add a preview order key and a preview all key-- when pressed, display whatever the piece is going to do.
    Arrows to show movement, ghost pieces for building, etc.
x Display prices in menus for building units and buildings
    x Display prices for units
    x Display prices for buildings (unify build orders for all pieces?)
* Add an intersitial screen when swapping active players for local coop, to hide moves
x Improve the main menu
x Add context menu to battle screen for submitting turn, saving, quitting to menu, etc
x Game end screens / match review with statistics(?)
    * Improve the look and feel of the stats screen
* Add UI to unit popup menus to indicate you're attempting to take an action that will be contested
  (e.g. trying to build while contested)
x Add 'serialize' method to managers, use this when saving or loading the game state
x Create a separate 'buy' menu better suited to showing lots of upgrades / pieces to purchase, or add a scroll bar
* Add autosave to battle and level editor
* Add a prematch lobby where you can assign teams and wait for connections / kick connections, etc.
* Include a base font for the game

Engineering
* Write tests!!
x Set up packaging this into an executable
    x Determine directory structure -- do maps / saves need to be put somewhere else?
x Improve rendering performance
    x Rendering large maps chugs. Look into pygame.display.update, and only updating the portion around the camera viewport? (note: this would be minimal, since large portions of the screen are updated at a time)
    x Cull rendering for entities outside the camera? (note: this was a huuuuuge boost)
    x Optimize animation to use scrolling surfaces and not lists of surfs (note: this was a minor boost)

Bug fixes
x Fix map scaling + ui screen nonsense for map1 and map2 (e.g. small maps)
x Fix popup menus scrolling off the top of the screen
x Fix resources not being deducted for placing buildings
x Fix invalid order effects showing for all teams
x Fix trying to RAISE or LOWER terrain past the edge of the tile types
x fix not being able to issue BUILD orders when an ally is on the required tile (e.g. ally on an adjacent resource tile)
x Fix the loggers not outputting to separate files: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11232230/logging-to-two-files-with-different-settings
* Fix level editor click+hold taking effect when clicking the pause menu
* Fix level editor generating new maps via an error in loading files, rather than an explicit action?
* Fix level editor scrolling piece types when scrolling the pause menu
x Fix team assumptions from the network manager -- because it's loaded before the map, it can't know what teams are in the game
    x Loaded map ahead of time, and network manager gains a team from the host when polling for the map data
* Fix window gaining focus + clicking on a menu option confirms that menu option


Gameplay
x Build support for upgrades, enable purchasing them from the base
    x Double check whether I'm using piece prices or the team-specific piece prices, etc.
    x Fill out more upgrades now that the framework is in place
    x Fill out basic T2 unit upgrades
x Add additional tiers for units
* Add ultimate tiers for units
x Modify GHOST movement type to be unable to stop on the same tile as enemy buildings
x Decide where the BUILD phase should slot into the order. Currently impossible to interrupt production
x Decide whether GHOSTS should be able to contest buildings-- currently can't enter, but if they do they can block it forever
    x Pieces that can't attack buildings do not contest them either, now.

* Implement parting shots -- when two units were contesting last turn, if one unit stays on that tile
    and the other doesn't, the remaining unit gets a free weak attack against the retreating unit
* Implement colonist building flipping
x Implement colonist terraforming
x Implement unique upgrades as generic attributes
    x Whether this piece contests enemies, and can be contested
    x Whether this piece impedes movement, and is affected by impedance
    x Additional defensive bonuses + entrenchment bonuses
    * Whether this piece is affected by parting shots

x Add a 'heal' action? Piece doesn't move and instead works on healing itself by a small amount.
* Determine whether pieces contest a tile if they're moving / leaving that tile.
    * Because BUILD actions pop before MOVE actions, at start of turn if we're contested, we stay contested even though the enemy moves off of us

Gameplay considerations
x Prevent Colonists from occupying enemy buildings
x Prevent Colonists from contesting enemies
x Decide whether having a three-resource system adds all that much-- personally I don't like how fiddly that can be, but the upside is that if you focus on
    one of the three archetypes you can optimize your production towards them. Need to decide whether I want to encourage that kind of specialization.

Networking
x Send the map / save data back and forth
x Upon submitting a turn, don't allow modifying the turn unless you cancel submission
    x Check that if you cancel an order already submitted (e.g. MoveOrder -> None) it cancels it out
x Gracefully handle connects / disconnects
x Support for connecting to a custom IP
x Check that victory checking + conceding works
* Support marking events as coming from the network or local. Use this when deciding whether to forward an event on to the network

Kegan's Special to do list
x Allow ESC to cancel out of menus
x Unit info popup
x Trim price UI down to 2 digits
    x Adjust method to not always output a 3 digit number, right justify
x Don't prompt to build generators on tiles with pieces on them already
x Rename wait -> cancel, don't show if no order is currently queued
x Remove 'None' tile type, no point
x Invalid build order cue should show up on ALL pieces with a BUILD order
    x Verbose tooltips
