x Create a separate 'buy' menu better suited to showing lots of upgrades / pieces to purchase, or add a scroll bar

Engineering
* Write tests!!
* Set up packaging this into an executable
    * Determine directory structure -- do maps / saves need to be put somewhere else?

* Fix map scaling + ui screen nonsense for map1 and map2 (e.g. small maps)
* Fix popup menus scrolling off the top of the screen
x Fix resources not being deducted for placing buildings

Gameplay
x Build support for upgrades, enable purchasing them from the base
    x Double check whether I'm using piece prices or the team-specific piece prices, etc.
    * Fill out more upgrades now that the framework is in place
* Add additional tiers for units
x Modify GHOST movement type to be unable to stop on the same tile as enemy buildings
x Decide where the BUILD phase should slot into the order. Currently impossible to interrupt production

* Implement parting shots -- when two units were contesting last turn, if one unit stays on that tile
    and the other doesn't, the remaining unit gets a free weak attack against the retreating unit
* Implement colonist building flipping
* Implement colonist terraforming
* Implement unique upgrades as generic attributes
    * Whether this piece contests enemies, and can be contested
    * Whether this piece impedes movement, and is affected by impedance
    * Additional defensive bonuses + entrenchment bonuses
    * Whether this piece is affected by parting shots

Networking
* Send the map / save data back and forth
* Upon submitting a turn, don't allow modifying the turn unless you cancel submission
    * Check that if you cancel an order already submitted (e.g. MoveOrder -> None) it cancels it out
* Gracefully handle connects / disconnects
* Support for connecting to a custom IP
